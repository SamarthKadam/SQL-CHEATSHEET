What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987


What Can SQL do?
SQL can execute queries against a database
SQL can retrieve data from a database
SQL can insert records in a database
SQL can update records in a database
SQL can delete records from a database
SQL can create new databases
SQL can create new tables in a database
SQL can create stored procedures in a database
SQL can create views in a database
SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

Using SQL in Your Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
To use SQL to get the data you want
To use HTML / CSS to style the page

Basic Query looks like this:
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE ID=2 ORDER BY first_name

SELECT:
SELECT * FROM customers                                             ///Selects every column from the customers table
SELECT first_name,last_name,points*10 as increPoints from customers ///Selects only specified column and values can be modified and also named something different using AS
SELECT DISTINCT state from customers                                ///Does not allow duplicates of mentioned field that is state

WHERE:
We can have many operaters that can be used beside where.Some of them are
>
<
>=
<=
!= or <>
SELECT * from customers where birth_date>'1987-01-01'

AND,OR,NOT
SELECT * from customers where state='VA' or points>=2000

IN 
SELECT * from customers where state='VA' or state='CO'
instead of going with above statements in makes it easy.We can say like it is for the OR elimination
SELECT * from customers where state IN ('VA','CO')

BETWEEN
SELECT * from customers where points>=1000 AND points<=2000
instead of going with above statements between makes it easy.We can say like it is for the AND elimination
SELECT * from customers where points BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000

LIKE
It is used for matching string like ends with, starts with, contains like statements some of the examples are
SELECT * from customers where first_name like'%y'                    ///Get all customers where last_name end with y
SELECT * from customers where first_name like'y%'                    //Get all customers where last_name start with y
SELECT * FROM customers where first_name like '%y%'                  //Get  all the customers where last_name contains y in the middle

Or we can also have statements like
SELECT * FROM customers where first_name like '_____y'                ///Get all the attr where first_name contains 6 letters where ending letter is y


REGEXP
We can use regexp as these are powerful when we are working with strings

SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp '^B'             ///Get all the customers whose lastname starts with b
SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp 'y$'             ///Get all the customers whose lastname ends with y
SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp 'oa|se'          ///Get all the customers which contain consectives oa or se
SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp '^bo|ay$'        ///Get all the customers which stars with bo or ends with ay
SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp '[oa]g'          //Get all the customers where last_name has O or A preceding g
SELECT * from customers where last_name regexp '[a-h]g          //Get all the customers where last_name has A-H preceding g


IS NULL
SELECT * from customers where phone is null                    //Get all customers where phone is null
SELECT * from customers where phone is not null                //Get all customers where phone is not null

ORDER BY
SELECT * from customers order by first_name desc              //Select all the customers firstname by descending order default it is ascending order
SELECT * from customers order by first_name,last_name         //Select all the customers firstname by asceding order, if first_name is same then go through last_name asceding order
 
LIMIT
limit the data like
SELECT * FROM customers limit 3                               //We would only get 3 data
SELECT * FROM customers limit 6,3                             //Here we would skip 6 documents and get next 3 docs
